		# especially since the velocity data drops at high frequencies and may sometimes not be cleaned up for some time

		# So we compute all required transforms in one pass, at the price of quite an unwieldy code

		# in which we store the relevant computations from the velocity data
		# Those accumulators are of size [nstarts, 3], and we fill each row after the other
